# Figure 4
Performance comparison of AGPCA, GPCA and SPCA in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the synthetic data. For each sparse PC loading (PC1 or PC2), accuracy measures proportion of the number of correct cases to number of all cases, sensitivity measures proportion of true nonzero elements that are correctly identified, and specificity measures the proportion of zero elements that are correctly identified. The bar plots of the average values of 50 realizations on the synthetic data with respect to different noise levels were shown with error bars.
